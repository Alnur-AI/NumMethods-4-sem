# HOMEWORK 3: Spline interpolations

## Description

task3.3.py - This program performs spline interpolation on a uniform grid


test.ans - output data on the Y axis (formed by the formula of spline interpolation)

test.dat - output data on the X axis (a new interpolation is formed from this data)

train.ans - input data along the Y axis (we build interpolation from them)

train.dat - input data on the X axis (we build interpolation from them)

## Usage

Open folder with interpolation that's you need and use this commands to solve equations

```bash
python3 task3.3.py
```
## Results
![Result](./results.png "Results")
